# My Ultimate Vim/Bash/Tmux

Over the last 10 years, I have used and tweaked Vim. This configuration is the ultimate vimrc (or at least my version of it).

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/austinyhc/dotvim.git ~/.vim
$ make init
```

I recommend reading the docs of these plugins to understand them better. Each plugin provides a much better Vim experience.

## Looking for a remote-first job?

Maintaining this configuration isn't my day job. Daily I am the founder/CEO of SensorAI. You could come and help us build the workspace of the future while living a balanced life (anywhere in the world 🌎🌍🌏). 

PS: Using Vim isn't a requirement 😁
