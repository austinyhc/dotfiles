Over the last 10 years, I have used and tweaked Vim. This configuration is the ultimate vim configuration or at least my version of it.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/austinyhc/dotvim.git ~/.vim

## Key Mappings

The [leader](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/06.html#leader) is `,`, so whenever you see `<leader>` it means `,`.

### Normal mode mappings

Fast saving of a buffer (`<leader>w`):

```
nmap <leader>w :w!<cr>
```

Useful mappings for managing tabs:

```
map <leader>tn :tabnew<cr>
map <leader>to :tabonly<cr>
map <leader>tc :tabclose<cr>
map <leader>tm :tabmove 

" Opens a new tab with the current buffer's path
" Super useful when editing files in the same directory
map <leader>te :tabedit <C-r>=expand("%:p:h")<cr>/
```

### Plugin related mappings

Open [bufexplorer](https://github.com/vim-scripts/bufexplorer.zip) to see and manage the current buffers (`<leader>o`):

```
map <leader>o :BufExplorer<cr>
```

Open [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) plugin to quickly find a file or a buffer (`<leader>j` or `<ctrl>f`):

```
" Quickly find and open a file in the CWD
let g:ctrlp_map = '<C-f>'

" Quickly find and open a recently opened file
map <leader>f :MRU<CR>

" Quickly find and open a buffer
map <leader>b :CtrlPBuffer<cr>
```

[NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) mappings:

```
map <leader>nn :NERDTreeToggle<cr>
map <leader>nb :NERDTreeFromBookmark 
map <leader>nf :NERDTreeFind<cr>
```

Maintaining this configuration isn't my day job. Daily I am the founder/CEO of SensorAI. You could come and help us build the workspace of the future while living a balanced life (anywhere in the world üåéüåçüåè).

PS: Using Vim isn't a requirement üòÅ
