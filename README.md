# My Ultimate Vim Configurations

Over the last 10 years, I have used and tweaked Vim. This configuration is the ultimate vimrc (or at least my version of it).

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/austinyhc/dotvim.git ~/.vim
$ make init
```
## Included Plugins

I recommend reading the docs of these plugins to understand them better. Each plugin provides a much better Vim experience.

- [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree): A tree explorer plugin for vim
- [Tagbar](https://github.com/preservim/tagbar): A class outline viewer for Vim
- [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors): Sublime Text style multiple selections for Vim, CTRL+N is remapped to CTRL+S (due to YankRing)
- [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive): A Git wrapper so awesome, it should be illegal
- [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim): Fuzzy file, buffer, mru and tag finder. It's mapped to `<Ctrl+F>`

## Looking for a remote-first job?

Maintaining this configuration isn't my day job. Daily I am the founder/CEO of SensorAI. You could come and help us build the workspace of the future while living a balanced life (anywhere in the world 🌎🌍🌏). 

PS: Using Vim isn't a requirement 😁
