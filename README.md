This repository contains all the configurations that I used over the past 10 years for zsh, vim, neovim, tmux, git, gdb and some extended defines/aliases for gnu-bash.

#### Looking for a remote job?

Maintaining this configuration isn't my day job. Daily I am the founder/CEO of [sensor.ai](https://github.com/sensorai). You could come and help us build the workspace of the future while living a balanced life (anywhere in the world 🌎🌍🌏).

PS: Using Vim isn't a requirement 😁
